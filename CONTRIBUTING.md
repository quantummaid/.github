# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/quantummaid/shared_invite/zt-cx5qd605-vG10I~WazfgH9WOnXMzl3Q). We want you working on things you're excited about.

## Testing

All functionality in all QuantumMaid projects is tested in an end-to-end fashion. Please write tests in the same way for new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to the QuantumMaid sub-project you'd like to contribute to with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include tests. Please follow our coding conventions (below).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

You can find our coding conventions [here](https://github.com/quantummaid/quantummaid-opensource-parent).
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.

Thanks,
the QuantumMaid Team
